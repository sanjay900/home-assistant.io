The **Bosch Alarm Panel** {% term integration %} allows you to connect your [Bosch Alarm Panels](https://www.boschsecurity.com) to Home Assistant in order to control and monitor your Bosch Alarm Panels.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

Supported panels:

* _Solution 2000/3000/4000_
* B Series: _B3512/B4512/B5512/B6512_
* G Series: _B8512G/B9512G_
* _AMAX 2100/3000/4000_
* _D7412GV4/D9412GV4_ [^1]

[^1]: Firmware 2.0+

## Provided entities

The {% term entities %} are divided into four subdomains:

* [AlarmControlPanel](#alarm-control-panel)
* [BinarySensor](#binary-sensor)
* [Sensor](#sensor)
* [Switch](#switch)
* [Lock](#lock)

## Alarm Control Panel

This integration adds a Alarm Control Panel device for each configured area, with the ability to issue arm/disarm commands.
This entity reports state (_disarmed_, _armed_away_, etc), and contains custom attributes _ready_to_arm_ (_no_|_home_|_away_), and a _faulted_points_ counter.

## Binary Sensor

A binary sensor is added for each point configured on your alarm.

## Sensor

Two sensors are added, one containing the history events from your panel, and another containing the current faults from it.
The history itself is stored on a `history` attribute, as there is a limit to how much text a sensor can store in its state.

## Switch

A switch is added for each output configured on the panel. Note that for some panels, only outputs with the type set to "remote output" can be controlled via _Mode 2_ API.

## Lock

A lock is added for each configured door on your panel  (_Solution 4000_, _B Series_ and _G Series_ panels only).

## Actions

The integration provides the following actions.

### Action: Set Panel Date & Time

| Data attribute         | Optional | Description                                                                     |
|------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `datetime`             | Yes      | The Date & Time to set. Defaults to the current date and time if it is not set. |

## Authentication

The primary means of authentication for the _Mode 2_ API is the _Automation_ passcode. It needs to be at least 10 characters long, and it is different from the _User_ code -- a shorter numeric pin used to arm/disarm the panel.
The integration will prompt for the required passcodes, which depend on the panel type.

| Panel | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Solution | User [^2] |
| B Series | Automation |
| G Series | Automation |
| AMAX | Both |

[^2]: The user needs to have the "master code functions" authority if you wish to interact with history events.

⚠️ Since the _Mode 2_ automation user has "superuser" privileges, it bypasses the regularly-configured alarm pin: you will _not_ be prompted for a _User_ code when arming/disaming through the integration.
The integration also supports (optionally) setting a Home Assistant-local pin to protect these operations -- it does not need to match any of the codes configured on the panel.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
